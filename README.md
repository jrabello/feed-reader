# FeedReader TDD - Test Driven Development

In this project we use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test framework to create some tests and raise the probability that our application will work as expected by testing if:

1. Feeds were defined properly
2. Side bar behaves as expected when clicked
3. Data fetched from web is inside HTML DOM
